# Hanzy Stylez

Hanzy Stylez is an e-commerce website that I developed as a personal project. This platform allows users to browse and shop seamlessly, offering a responsive design that works flawlessly across all devices.

## About the Project

This project was created and structured by Benz Samson Tagle, leveraging my skills in front-end development. I utilized a variety of React tools and hooks to build this application, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. Key features include:

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be fully responsive, providing a consistent browsing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **React Tools**: I used React components, React Router for navigation, and state management with React hooks such as useState and useEffect.
- **Styled Components**: For styling, I used styled-components to create a modular and maintainable CSS architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling in-app navigation.
- **Styled-components**: For CSS-in-JS styling.
- **Context API**: For state management across the application.
